# Formal Text Style Transfer using GPT-2

## Overview
This project focuses on formal text style transfer using GPT-2, a powerful language model by OpenAI. The goal is to transform informal text into formal text while preserving meaning.

## Methodology
- **Fine-tuning GPT-2**: We fine-tuned the GPT-2 model on the GYAFC dataset. The notebook `TextStyleTransfer(3)(1).ipynb` contains the code for this fine-tuning process.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - **Formality Score**: We fine-tuned a BERT model on the same GYAFC dataset to evaluate the formality of generated text.
  - **Meaning Preservation**: To assess meaning preservation, we calculated the cosine similarity between the input and output sentences. Higher similarity indicates better preservation of meaning.

## Files
- **TextStyleTransfer(3)(1).ipynb**: Jupyter notebook containing the code for fine-tuning GPT-2 on the GYAFC dataset.

## Results
- **Formality Score**: (Insert formality score results here)
- **Meaning Preservation Metric**: (Insert cosine similarity results here)

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `TextStyleTransfer(3)(1).ipynb` to fine-tune the GPT-2 model on your dataset and run 'formality_model.ipynb' for calculating formality_score.
3. Finally come back to `TextStyleTransfer(3)(1).ipynb` copy the model_configs and tokenizer_configs generated by the gpt2 model and similarly from the formality_model.ipynb to get output and formality_score
